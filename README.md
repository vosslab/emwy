# emwy

**emwy** stands for "*edit movies with yaml*" it is a command line tool for 
splicing and combining movies.

# Why emwy?

Most GUI based NLE (non-linear editors) have a high latency while
editing which slowed things down and did not match my style. 

I did a search for other command line editors, but did not find any at
the time, so I wrote my own. Since I have found two:

* [AviSynth](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page)
* [MLT Multimedia Framework](https://www.mltframework.org/)

but they did not have any good documentation,
[see stackexchange](https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/7459/)

>  "powerful, if somewhat obscure, multitrack command line oriented video editorâ€¦"
